\section{Preliminaries}
	For a set $S$, $S^{*}$ are all finite sequences of elements from $S$.
	For such a sequence $s\in S^{*}$ the number of elements is denoted by $|s|$
	and the set of elements of the sequence is denoted by $\Lbag s\Rbag$.
	Furthermore $s(i)$ refers to the $i$-th element of the sequence $s$.
	For a tupel $A = (B,C,D,...)$ for the single components
	$B_A,C_A,D_A,...$ is used as long as $A$ is clear from the context.
	Additionally, a function restricted to a subset $A$ of its domain is denoted
	by $f\upharpoonright{A}$.
	Functions defined for a set $V$ are lifted to the sequence
	$V^{*}$ and the power set $\mathbb{P}(V)$ by elementwise application.
	For a finite set $A$ the function $\enum_{A}:|A|\rightarrow A$ returns an
	enumeration of the elements of $A$.
	And finally, for a function $f$ $f[e\mapsto v]$describes a function that
	mirrors $f$ except for $e$ where it maps to $v$, i.e. for an
	$e\in\mathit{dom}(f)$ and $v\in\mathit{img}(f)$ 
	\begin{equation*}
		f[e\mapsto v](x) =
		\begin{cases}
			v &\text{if } x = e\\
			f(x) &\text{otherwise}\\
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
